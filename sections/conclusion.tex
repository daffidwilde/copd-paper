\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Summarise the findings and novelty of the paper: sensitivity analysis and
queuing models are within reach despite a lack of data. The chosen modelling
discipline for service times is very simplistic but can return good results
(refer back to best-case parameter plot).

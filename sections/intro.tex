\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Population health research is becoming increasingly based on data-driven methods
(as opposed to those designed solely by clinical experts) for patient-centred
care through the advent of accessible software and a relative abundance of
electronic data. A vital part of such research is to better understand the
healthcare needs and behaviours of a population, and it can be beneficial to
find an appropriate segmentation of that population; such a segmentation allows
for finer-grained analysis of groups in the population that share some form of
homogeneity. One commonly used method for such patient-centred analysis is that
of patient flow and their interaction with the healthcare system.

However, this process relies heavily on detailed data --- about both the system
and the population within that system --- which may limit research where
sophisticated data pipelines are not yet in place. This work demonstrates how
this issue may be overcome using administrative, spell-level, hospital data,
i.e.\ a dataset that summarises patient spells. This data is then used to build
a patient clustering that feeds into a multi-class queuing model. Specifically,
this work examines records of patient spells from the National Health Service
(NHS) Wales Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board (UHB) that present chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  COPD is of particular interest to Cwm Taf
Morgannwg UHB as the condition is known to often present as a comorbidity in
patients~\cite{Houben2019} and it was found that they had the highest prevalence
of the condition across all the Welsh health boards in an internal report by NHS
Wales.

\subsection{Literature review}\label{subsec:review}

Given the subject matter of this work, the relevant literature spans much of
operational research in healthcare and the focus of this review is on the
principal topics of segmentation analysis, queuing models applied to hospital
systems, and the handling of missing or incomplete data for such queues.

\subsubsection{Segmentation analysis}

Segmentation analysis allows for the targeted analysis of otherwise
heterogeneous datasets and encompasses several techniques from operational
research, statistics and machine learning. One of the most desirable qualities
of this kind of analysis is the ability to glean and communicate simplified
summaries of patient needs to stakeholders within a healthcare
system~\cite{Vuik2016b, Yoon2020}. For instance, clinical profiling often
forms part of the wider analysis where each segment can be summarised in a
phrase or infographic~\cite{Vuik2016a, Yan2019}.

The review for this work identified three commonplace groups of patient
characteristics used to segment a patient population: their system
utilisation metrics, their clinical attributes and their pathway. The latter
is not used to segment the patients directly but rather groups their movements
through a healthcare system. This is typically done via process
mining.~\cite{Arnolds2018}~and~\cite{Delias2015} demonstrate how this technique
can be used to improve the efficiency of a hospital system as opposed to
tackling the more relevant issue of patient-centred care. The remaining
characteristics can be segmented with a number of techniques but recent works
tend to use unsupervised methods, typically latent class analysis (LCA) or
clustering~\cite{Yan2018}.

LCA is a statistical, model-based method used to identify groups (called latent
classes) in data by relating its observations to some unobserved (latent),
categorical attribute. This attribute has multiple categories, each
corresponding to a latent class. The discovered relations are then used to
separate the observations into latent classes according to their maximum
likelihood class membership~\cite{Hagenaars2002,Lazarsfeld1968}. This method has
proved useful in the study of comorbidity patterns as
in~\cite{Kuwornu2014,Larsen2017} where combinations of demographic and clinical
attributes are related to various subgroups of chronic diseases.

Similarly to LCA, clustering identifies groups (clusters) in data to produce a
labelling of its instances. However, clustering includes a wide variety of
methods where the common theme is to maximise homogeneity within, and
heterogeneity between, each cluster~\cite{Everitt2011}. The \(k\)-means paradigm
is the most popular form of clustering in literature. The method iteratively
partitions numerical data into \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) distinct parts where \(k\)
is fixed a priori. This method has proved popular as it is easily scalable and
its implementations are concise~\cite{Olafsson2008,Wu2009}. In addition to
\(k\)-means, hierarchical clustering methods can be effective if a suitable
number of parts cannot be found initially~\cite{Vuik2016a}. Although, supervised
hierarchical segmentation methods such as classification and regression trees
(as in~\cite{Harper2006}) have been used where an existing, well-defined label
is of particular significance.

\subsubsection{Queuing models}

Since the seminal works by Erlang~\cite{Erlang1917,Erlang1920} established
the core concepts of queuing theory, the application of queues and queuing
networks to real services has become abundant including the healthcare service.
By applying these models to healthcare settings, many aspects of the underlying
system can be studied. A common area of study in healthcare settings is of
service capacity.~\cite{McClain1976} is an early example of such work where
acute bed capacity was determined using hospital occupancy data. Meanwhile, more
modern works such as~\cite{Palvannan2012,Pinto2014} consider wider sources of
data (where available) to build their queuing models. Moreover, the output of
a model is catered more towards being actionable --- as is the prerogative of
operational research. For instance,~\cite{Pinto2014} devises new categorisations
for both hospital beds and arrivals that are informed by the queuing model.

In addition to results from these abstract models, healthcare queuing research
has expanded to include computer simulation models. These areas include the
construction and simulation of Markov processes via process
mining~\cite{Arnolds2018,Rebuge2012} or patient flow~\cite{Bhattacharjee2014}.

The software used is Ciw~\cite{Palmer2019}.  % TODO Write this section

\subsubsection{Handling incomplete queue data}

As is discussed in other parts of this section, the data available in this work
is not as fine as in other comparative works. Without access to such distinct
and detailed data --- but with the aim of gaining insight from what is available
--- it is imperative that the gap left by the incomplete data be bridged.

Indeed, it is often the case that in practical situations where suitable data is
not (immediately) available, further inquiry will stop in that particular line
of research. Queuing models in healthcare settings appear to be such a case
where the line ends at incomplete queue data.~\cite{Asanjarani2017} is a
bibliographic work that collates articles on the estimation of queuing system
characteristics --- including their parameters.  Despite its breadth of almost
300 publications from 1955, only two articles have been identified as being
applied to healthcare:~\cite{Mohammadi2012,Yom2014}.  Both works are concerned
with customers that can re-enter services during their time in the queuing
system. This is particularly of value when considering the effect of
unpredictable behaviour in intensive care units, for
instance.~\cite{Mohammadi2012} seeks to approximate service and re-service
densities through a Bayesian approach and by separating out those customers
seeking to be serviced again. On the other hand,~\cite{Yom2014} considers an
extension to the \(M/M/c\) queue with direct re-entries. The devised model is
then used to determine resource requirements in two healthcare settings.

Aside from healthcare-specific works, the approximation of
queue parameters has formed a part of relevant modern queuing research. However,
the scope is largely focused on theoretic approximations rather than by
simulation.~\cite{Djabali2018,Goldenshluger2016} are two such recent
works that consider an underlying process to estimate a general service time
distribution in single server and infinite server queues respectively.

\subsection{Overview of the dataset and its clustering}\label{subsec:overview}

The dataset used in this work was provided by the Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB.\ The
dataset contains an administrative summary of \input{tex/npatients}patients
presenting COPD from \input{tex/min_date}through \input{tex/max_date}totalling
\input{tex/nspells}spells. A patient (hospital) spell is defined as the
continuous stay of a patient using a hospital bed on premises controlled by a
health care provider and is made up of one or more patient
episodes~\cite{NHS2020}.

The spells included in the dataset are described by the following attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personal identifiers and information, i.e.\ patient and spell ID
        numbers, and gender.
    \item Admission/discharge dates and approximate times.
    \item Attributes summarising the clinical path of the spell including
        admission/discharge methods, and the number of episodes, consultants and
        wards in the spell.
    \item International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and primary
        Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) codes from each episode.
    \item Indicators for any COPD intervention. The value for any given spell is
        one of no intervention, pulmonary rehabilitation, specialist nursing,
        and both interventions.
    \item Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) contributions from several long term
        conditions (LTCs) as well as indicators for some other conditions such
        as sepsis and obesity.
    \item Rank under the 2019 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD)
        indicating relative deprivation of the postcode area the patient lives
        in.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the above, the following attributes were engineered for each
spell:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Age and spell cost data were linked to approximately half of the
        spells in the dataset from another administrative dataset provided by
        the Cwm Taf Morgannwg UHB.\
    \item The presenting ICD codes were generalised to their categories
        according to NHS documentation and counts for each category were
        attached.
    \item The number of COPD-related admissions in the last twelve months based
        on the associated patient ID number.
\end{itemize}

Due to a lack of information about the patients themselves --- beyond their
COPD-related admissions --- the spells of the dataset were segmented using a
variant of the \(k\)-means algorithm. This variant, called \(k\)-prototypes,
allows for the clustering of mixed-type data by performing \(k\)-means on the
numeric attributes and \(k\)-modes on the categoric. Both \(k\)-prototypes and
\(k\)-modes were presented in~\cite{Huang1998}.

The attributes included in the clustering encompass both utilisation metrics and
clinical attributes relating to the spell. They were as follows: the summative
clinical path attributes, the CCI contributions and condition indicators, the
WIMD rank, length of stay (LOS), COPD intervention status, and the engineered
attributes (not including age and costs due to lack of coverage).

To determine the optimal number of clusters, \(k\), the knee point detection
algorithm introduced in~\cite{Satopaa2011} was used with a range of potential
values for \(k\) from 2 to 10. This range was chosen based on what may be
considered feasibly informative to stakeholders. The knee point detection
algorithm can be considered a deterministic version of the popular `elbow
method' for determining a number of clusters. This revealed an optimal value for
\(k\) of 4 but both 3 and 5 clusters were considered. Each case was eliminated
due to a lack of clear separation in the characteristics of the clusters.
Additionally, the initialisation method used for \(k\)-prototypes was that
presented in~\cite{Wilde2020} as it was found to give an improvement in the
clustering over other initialisation methods.

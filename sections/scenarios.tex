\section{Adjusting the queuing model}\label{sec:scenarios}

Body of the writing and plots come here. What can we see in the what-if
scenarios? The main scenarios are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How would server utilisation (i.e.\ resource consumption) be affected
        by an increase in overall patient arrivals?
    \item How is the system affected by certain types of patients (e.g.\
        short-stay, low-impact) arriving less frequently?
    \item What are the sensitivities of mean system times and server utilisation
        based on a change in \(c\)?
\end{itemize}
